# Frogophone

Frogophone is a MIDI instrument made from a soft toy, created by [BERSS](https://rusu.rmit.edu.au/Clubs/BERSS) at their [2024 Hackathon](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-mOJVxqIss/) for the [Adaptive Music Bridging Program](https://myo.org.au/programs/ensemble-program/adaptive-music-bridging-program/).
